## Introduction
What makes a name timeless or trendy? In this project, we use data published by the U.S. Social Security Administration spanning over a hundred years to understand American baby name trends.

## Project Tasks
We'll be answering the following questions:
1. What are the classic names that have been given to more than 5000 babies every year?
2. Classify each name's popularity according to the number of years that the name appears in the dataset.
3. What are the ten highest-ranked American female names in our dataset?
4. Pick a specific name with certain criterias.
5. Find the cumulative number of babies named Olivia over the years since the name first appeared in our dataset
6. Write a query that selects the year and the maximum num of babies given any male name in that year.
7. Look up the first_name that corresponds to the maximum number of babies given a specific male name in a year.(Using the code from the previous task)
8. What are the first names that have been the top male first name in any year along with a count of the number of years that name has been the top name.
